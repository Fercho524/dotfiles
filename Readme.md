You must find the program that you need the configuration, youll enter to the config folder and you can copy the code, but you have to been sure that you make the adaptatios for your hardware, the dotfiles are not an extra layer that you can install with a simple script, no for now, maybe in the future i can do that, but not for now :(

## Pannel settings

### i3blocks
you have 3 choises:

**Text and icons**

Use the SpaceMono NF for look better and picom without blur

**Powerline static**

i3blocks powerline stable and customisable but static colors.

**Powerline dynamic (experimental)**

I made an script that use JSON format themes for styling the bar but sometimes have errors with the storage indicator.

### Tint2

If you want to change the tint2 horientation, you have to edit the autostart.sh on the .bin folder replacing the next, the colors are generated by the script with pywal.

```sh
	if [ $($(pgrep tint2)) ]; then
		killall -q tint2
	else
		bash ~/.config/tint2/tint2.sh vertical &
	fi
```
