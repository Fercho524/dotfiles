## Installation

You must find the program that you need the configuration, you'll need enter to the config folder and you can copy the code, but you have to been sure that you make the adaptations for your hardware. The Dotfiles are not an extra layer that you can install with a simple script, no for now, maybe in the future I can do that, but not for now :(
